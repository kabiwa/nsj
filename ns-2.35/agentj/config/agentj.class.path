# This file is used to define application classes that should be redefined.
# This can be used instead of, or in conjunction with an AGENTJ_CLASSPATH environment variable.
# NOTE: The AGENTJ_CLASSPATH variable is read in the same as other environment variables, i.e. the full
# path to files is expected, as well as system dependent path and file separators.
# This file, on the other hand defines then relative to the agentj home env variable with forward slashes
# for any system.
# a line separated list of classpath components defined relative to the $AGENTJ env variable
# NOTE: use forward slashes even on windows
# NOTE: This file should end with a new line
