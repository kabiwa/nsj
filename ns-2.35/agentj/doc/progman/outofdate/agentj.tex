\part{Introduction, Overview and Installation}

In this part, we given an introduction and overview of \agentj~including the underlying technologuies that \agentj~encapsulates.  We then provide a detail account of how to install \agentj~into the NS2 simulation environment for the simulation of Java distributed applications.

\part{\agentj~Design and Implementation}

In this part, we describe the design and implemantation of \agentj. We describe the underlying toolkit, Protoli and PAI and then describe how \agentj~extends this behaviour into NS2 to provide a generic interface for simulating Java applications.

\part{Using \agentj}

In this part, we describe \agentj~from a user's perspective.  A typical user of \agentj~would be a programmer of a Java application who would like to simulate their distributed application within NS2.  In this part therefore, we describe how this can be achieved 
and which interfaces need to be implemented in order to build a bridge between NS2 and your distributed Java application.  A comprehensive example of such an integration can be found in the accompanying manual for P2PSX \cite{p2psx}, which integrates a comprehensive P2P middleware system into NS2 using \agentj.
