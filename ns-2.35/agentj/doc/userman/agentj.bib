However, the potential{\newline}		  offered by hardware technology often fails to be fully{\newline}		  realized due to the lack of software environments{\newline}		  supporting such efforts. Furthermore, the complexity of{\newline}		  combining within one application components with different{\newline}		  performance characteristics often prevents such{\newline}		  applications from achieving required performance levels.{\newline}		  The Ligature project at LANL addresses the issue of{\newline}		  designing a software infrastructure enabling fats and{\newline}		  efficient development of multi-component applications, and{\newline}		  that of providing performance guidance to the programmer{\newline}		  using this infrastructure. Ligature allows the programmer{\newline}		  to define component interfaces specifying how{\newline}		  heterogeneous, distributed components can interact within a{\newline}		  larger system and provides a reusable infrastructure{\newline}		  capable of connecting these components. These interfaces,{\newline}		  as well as information about component performance are{\newline}		  accessible through a database. Within this framework we are{\newline}		  trying to understand how information about the performance{\newline}		  of individual components, and information about performance{\newline}		  of the framework can be combined to develop a{\newline}		  performance-aware multicomponent application.},

Our project,{\newline}		  Virtual Distributed Computing Environment (VDCE), provides{\newline}		  a problem-solving environment for high-performance{\newline}		  distributed computing over wide area networks. VDCE{\newline}		  delivers well-defined library functions that relieve{\newline}		  end-users of tedious task implementations and also support{\newline}		  reusability. In this paper we present the conceptual design{\newline}		  of VDCE software architecture, which is defined in three{\newline}		  modules: a) the Application Editor, a user-friendly{\newline}		  application development environment that generates the{\newline}		  Application Flow Graph (AFG) of an application; b) the{\newline}		  Application Scheduler, which provides an efficient{\newline}		  task-to-resource mapping of AFG; and c) the VDCE Runtime{\newline}		  System, which is responsible for running and managing{\newline}		  application execution and monitoring the VDCE resources.},

	Abstract = {A description of dynamic distributed workflow and three{\newline}		  possible approaches to implementing a system that supports{\newline}		  it. A workflow is a sequence of tasks that must be{\newline}		  performed to accomplish a specific goal. A workflow should{\newline}		  be reusable, need not be a linear sequence --- it may have{\newline}		  forks, joins and loops. A workflow schema item can itself{\newline}		  be a workflow. Useful reference --- ``M. Merz, B. Liberman{\newline}		  and W. Lamersdorf. `Using Mobile Agents to Support{\newline}		  Interorganisational Workflow Management'.

@article{citeulike:228031,
	Abstract = {Web services are frequently described as the latest incarnation of distributed object technology. This misconception, perpetuated by people from both industry and academia, seriously limits broader acceptance of the true Web services architecture. Although the architects of many distributed and Internet systems have been vocal about the differences between Web services and distributed objects, dispelling the myth that they are closely related appears difficult. Many believe that Web services is a distributed systems technology that relies on some form of distributed object technology. Unfortunately, this is not the only common misconception about Web services. We seek to clarify several widely held beliefs about the technology that are partially or completely wrong. Within the distributed technology world, it is probably more appropriate to associate Web services with messaging technologies because they share a common architectural view, although they address different application types. Web services technology will have a dramatic enabling effect on worldwide interoperable distributed computing once everyone recognizes that Web services are about interoperable document-centric computing, not distributed objects.},
